## Introduction

The main goal of this project is to create a single web page with dynamicly created navbar depending on the number of sections that we have in the page, The page should be styled and includes the ability to navigate smoothly through the page sections by clicking on the links added to the navbar.

## HTML

First step in building a web page is to add the basic [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) structure to it, as the [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) acts as the building blocks of content in our web page which helps in having the vision needed for how the content should be displayed.<br />
And so, the first step was to create [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) file with the basic structure of all of the content that should be displayed on the page as well as adding the desired classes to the document elements.

## CSS

Second step that takes piriority is adding the styling for the [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) document that we just made, to help better visualize how the page should look to the end user, and luckily for us, [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp) is just the right tool for the job.<br />
With [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp) we could easily apply styles to our document using the classes that we predefined in it. It offers a variety of styling options, as well as the ability to help make our web page responsive to be usable across multiple platforms.

## JavaScript

Now that we have our page structure and layout ready. It is time to add functionality to it. and this is where [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_js.asp) come in. [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_js.asp) is the only programming language we approach in this project and basically it is responsible for all of the awesome interactive features that we see in web pages, using it we are able to create the dynamic navbar depending on the number of sections that we have in our page as required.<br />
But that isn't the only thing [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_js.asp) is good for, as it is a fully fledged programming language, it can basically help create a full web application, but as the requirments in this project are limited, so the features used were also limited to :

1. Dynamically create navbar links depending on the number of sections.
2. Added event listeners for clicks on navbar links to smoothly scroll through the page to the required section.
3. Collapsing the navbar depending on te type of device that the page is accessed from.
4. Tracking which section is in view and marking it as the active section in the navbar as well as adding a class to mark the section as active.

## Conclusion

This project showcases how all 3 basic elements for building a web page work together to create a responsive and interactive web page/ web application to bring the user a great experience.
